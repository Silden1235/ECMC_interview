# ECMC_interview
These test cases are written for a Technical Interview with ECMC

The testing framework around this is TestNG. I used Eclipse with Selenium and TestNG(plugin) set up to create and run the test cases in the SRC folder. The easiest way to run these is from Eclipse if you clone this repository to your machine.
